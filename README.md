# Python Learning Project

Welcome to my Python learning repository! 

## About This Project
This project is part of my Python coursework at Harbour Space University. 
I am just starting my journey with Python and will be uploading various exercises and projects as I continue to learn.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to document my progress as I learn Python, 
and to share my work with others who may be interested in seeing how I approach programming challenges.

## Getting Started
If you'd like to follow along or provide feedback, feel free to explore the code and projects I upload. 
Any constructive suggestions or improvements are always welcome!

## Notes
- This repository is a learning space, so the code might not be perfect or fully optimized yet.
- As I progress, I will continue to update and refine the work here.

Thank you for visiting my repository!
